# NanoPhi

Finetuning GPT-2 (124m) with Phi-1.5 like Data, to see how the model improves, and how strong tiny LMs can get

Sample textbook(gpt2 124m, first finetune), 
 - unexpected for the first try, to see GPT-2 124m, a model many people consider useless, to generate two coherent, multi paragraph textbook like outputs, could be perfect with repetition penalty

### Python Game Development for Cities

A game called "Cities: 4th Grade Mathematics" aims to teach 4th graders about the basics of mathematics, including the concepts of fraction, fractional, and matrix. By creating a game with the concept of fractions and fractional expressions, students can apply these skills to various problems in their lives.

### Python Game Development for Cities

Python's features and API allow for easy interaction between games and computers. This allows for increased accessibility and innovation in the field of mathematics. For example, the `pythagorean` game "Mathematics: Integration and Complexity" allows for easy play and execution with a single Python program.

### Real-world Applications

In conclusion, Python's capabilities and API are becoming increasingly important in the digital age. As companies continue to expand their libraries, AI, and algorithms, it is crucial for educators to support the development of games that cater to their diverse audience. This will ensure that Python's role in the creation and development of games is fully embraced and nurtured.
