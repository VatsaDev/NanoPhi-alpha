# NanoPhi

Finetuning GPT-2 (124m) with Phi-1.5 like Data, to see how the model improves, and how strong tiny LMs can get

Goals
 - work with GPT-2 124m and 355m, build up strong tiny LMs
 - try integrating Orca's student teacher style with GPT-2
 - Combine Phi informational capabilities, Orca, instruct/chat model, ultimate tinyLM?

Sample textbook(gpt2 124m, first finetune), 
 - unexpected for the first try, to see GPT-2 124m, a model many people consider useless, to generate a coherent, multi paragraph textbook like outputs, could be perfect with repetition penalty
